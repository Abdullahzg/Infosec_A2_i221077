WHAT EACH SCREENSHOT PROVES:
============================

GitHub Workflow (20%):
- 01: Shows 17 commits (exceeds 10 requirement)
- 02: Shows proper .gitignore excluding secrets

PKI Setup (20%):
- 03: CA generation works
- 04: Server certificate issued
- 05: Client certificate issued
- 06: Certificate details valid (SHA-256, RSA)

Registration & Login (20%):
- 07: Database schema with salt (varbinary 16) and pwd_hash (char 64)
- 10: Registration showing salt generation and password hashing

Encrypted Chat (20%):
- 08: Server startup
- 09: DH key exchange for session
- 11: Message encrypted and sent
- 12: Message received and decrypted

Integrity & Non-Repudiation (10%):
- 13: Session closure with receipt
- 14: Transcript with encrypted messages and signatures
- 15: Receipt with signed transcript hash
- 16: Offline verification tool

Testing & Evidence (10%):
- 17: BAD_CERT tests (expired, self-signed, untrusted)
- 18: SIG_FAIL test (tampering detection)
- 19: REPLAY test (replay attack detection)
- All screenshots show reproducible steps
- Terminal outputs visible
- Process is clear

GRADING RUBRIC COVERAGE:
========================

✓ GitHub: 17 commits, README, .gitignore, no secrets
✓ PKI: CA + server cert + client cert working
✓ Registration: Random salt, SHA-256 hashing, encrypted transit
✓ Encryption: DH key exchange, AES-128, PKCS#7 padding
✓ Integrity: RSA signatures, sequence numbers, replay protection
✓ Non-Repudiation: Transcripts, receipts, offline verification
✓ Testing: All steps shown with terminal output

NOTES FOR REPORTS:
==================

Use these screenshots in your reports:
- Main Report: Use 01-07 to show system setup
- Test Report: Use all 16 to show test results

Each screenshot has terminal output showing:
- Commands executed
- Results obtained
- Success/failure status

All screenshots are evidence that system works correctly.
